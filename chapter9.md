# Chapter 9 – Roadmap for the Next Decade

## 9.1 Emerging AI Techniques
- **Generative Models for Attack Simulation** – Use Stable‑Diffusion‑style models to generate realistic phishing emails, malware payloads, and network traffic for training.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – Apply GNNs to model attacker movement across complex supply chains and cloud infrastructures.
- **Federated Learning** – Enable multiple organizations to collaboratively train threat‑detection models without sharing raw logs.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – Integrate SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations into security workflows.
- **Zero‑Shot Learning** – Leverage large language models to detect novel attack patterns without labeled data.

## 9.2 Threat Landscape Evolution
- **AI‑Assisted Adversaries** – Attackers using generative models to craft polymorphic malware and social‑engineering content.
- **Supply‑Chain Attacks** – Increased complexity of cloud‑native supply chains and container ecosystems.
- **Regulatory Shifts** – Anticipated AI‑specific regulations (EU AI Act, US AI Bill of Rights).
- **Quantum‑Resistant Cryptography** – Transition to post‑quantum algorithms for secure communications.

## 9.3 Strategic Roadmap (2025‑2035)
| Year | Milestone | Key Actions |
