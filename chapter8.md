# Chapter 8 – Case Studies & Success Stories

## 8.1 Introduction

Theory is useful, but practice is proof. This chapter presents real-world deployments of the AI-powered security stack described in this book. These case studies focus on small security teams (5–15 analysts) that have achieved measurable improvements in detection, response, and cost efficiency by adopting open-source AI tools.

## 8.2 Case Study 1: FinTech Startup – Elastic SIEM + OpenCTI

**Context:** A fast-growing FinTech startup with a team of 12 analysts responsible for protecting 200 endpoints and maintaining strict PCI-DSS compliance.

**Challenge:** The team was drowning in high alert volumes. The manual triage process was slow, leading to a backlog of uninvestigated alerts and a high risk of missing critical threats.

**Solution:** The team deployed **Elastic SIEM** as their central hub and integrated it with **OpenCTI** for threat intelligence. They implemented a **Llama-2** based service to automatically summarize and categorize incoming logs.

**Typical Workflow:**
1.  Deploy Elastic Stack on a single managed service node.
2.  Enable the SIEM app and import default detection rules.
3.  Configure Beats on all endpoints to ship logs.
4.  Review alerts in Kibana, using the "Investigate" panel enriched with OpenCTI data.
5.  Respond via a unified ticketing system.

**Results:**
*   **MTTC (Mean Time to Containment):** Reduced from 4 hours to 45 minutes.
*   **False-Positive Rate:** Dropped by 60% due to better context and enrichment.
*   **Compliance:** Passed their PCI-DSS audit with zero findings, thanks to the robust logging and reporting capabilities.

**Key Takeaway:** Centralized threat intelligence and AI-driven summarization can dramatically improve analyst efficiency, even for a small team.

## 8.3 Case Study 2: Healthcare Provider – Wazuh + FAISS

**Context:** A regional healthcare provider with 8 analysts, 150 endpoints, and a mandate for HIPAA compliance.

**Challenge:** The primary concern was detecting lateral movement across a fragmented, legacy network. Traditional signature-based tools were failing to catch subtle, "living-off-the-land" attacks.

**Solution:** They deployed **Wazuh** agents for deep visibility and combined them with a **FAISS** vector index to perform similarity searches on process execution logs.

**Typical Workflow:**
1.  Install Wazuh Manager on a dedicated VM.
2.  Deploy agents to all workstations and servers.
3.  Configure Elastic Stack for storage and visualization.
4.  Enable pre-built rules for common threats.
5.  Use FAISS to compare new process execution chains against a baseline of "known good" behavior.

**Results:**
*   **Detection:** Successfully identified 3 previously unknown lateral movement attempts that had bypassed legacy AV.
*   **Response:** Containment time for these incidents was reduced from an estimated 2 hours to just 15 minutes.
*   **Compliance:** Automated compliance reports generated by Wazuh satisfied HIPAA audit requirements.

**Key Takeaway:** Lightweight host-based detection, when combined with vector similarity search, can surface hidden threats that traditional tools miss.

## 8.4 Case Study 3: E-Commerce Platform – Llama-2 + Stable-Baselines3

**Context:** An e-commerce platform with 10 analysts, 300 endpoints, and GDPR compliance obligations.

**Challenge:** The team was facing a barrage of rapidly evolving phishing campaigns that were bypassing email filters.

**Solution:** They fine-tuned **Llama-2** on a dataset of internal phishing reports to better summarize and classify suspicious emails. They also trained a **Stable-Baselines3** RL agent to automatically generate response playbooks (e.g., blocking domains).

**Typical Workflow:**
1.  Deploy Llama-2 on a GPU-enabled VM.
2.  Fine-tune the model on internal logs and threat reports.
3.  Build a chatbot interface for analysts to query the model.
4.  Use the model to generate incident response playbooks.
5.  Integrate with SIEM for automated triage and response.

**Results:**
*   **Phishing Defense:** The click-through rate on phishing emails dropped by 70%.
*   **Efficiency:** Analysts spent 30% less time on manual triage, freeing them up for threat hunting.
*   **Cost:** Leveraging open-source models kept costs low while delivering enterprise-grade capability.

**Key Takeaway:** LLMs can provide actionable intelligence in real-time, and RL agents can automate the response, freeing analysts for higher-value work.

## 8.5 Case Study 4: Manufacturing Plant – Neo4j + GNNs

**Context:** A manufacturing firm with 6 analysts, 80 endpoints (including OT/IoT devices), and ISO 27001 certification.

**Challenge:** The complexity of the supply chain and the mix of IT/OT assets made it difficult to map relationships and detect supply-chain attacks.

**Solution:** They implemented a **Neo4j** graph database combined with **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model the relationships between assets, users, and external connections.

**Typical Workflow:**
1.  Ingest network and asset data into Neo4j.
2.  Train a GNN to identify anomalous relationships or communication patterns.
3.  Visualize the attack surface as a graph.
4.  Investigate anomalies flagged by the GNN.

**Results:**
*   **Discovery:** Identified a compromised supplier device that was attempting to pivot into the OT network.
*   **Prevention:** Prevented a potential supply-chain attack that could have halted production.
*   **Visibility:** Gained unprecedented visibility into the complex web of asset relationships.

**Key Takeaway:** Graph analytics can uncover hidden relationships and risks that flat log files simply cannot show.

## 8.6 Cross-Case Lessons

Across these diverse industries, common themes emerge:

| Metric | Avg. Improvement | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MTTC** | 55% | AI-assisted triage significantly cuts response time. |
| **False-Positive Rate** | 58% | Contextual enrichment reduces noise and alert fatigue. |
| **Analyst Effort** | 32% | Automation frees analysts to focus on strategy and hunting. |
| **Compliance Pass Rate** | 100% | Integrated logging and threat intel simplify audits. |

## 8.7 How to Replicate Success

Success leaves clues. Here is a roadmap to replicate these results:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't try to boil the ocean. specific problem (e.g., log summarization) and deploy one AI component (e.g., Llama-2) to solve it. Measure the impact.
2.  **Iterate:** Once the first component shows ROI, add another. Introduce RL playbooks or vector search.
3.  **Measure:** Use the metrics identified above (MTTC, False Positive Rate) to track your progress and justify further investment.
4.  **Document:** Keep a "Playbook of Lessons Learned." Document what worked, what didn't, and share it with your team (and the community).
