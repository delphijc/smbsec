# Book Development Ideas

1. **Companion Web Portal** – Build a lightweight React site that hosts each chapter, live code snippets, and interactive demos (e.g., a sandboxed LLM summarizer).
2. **Hands‑On Labs** – Add a `labs/` folder with Docker‑Compose setups for each major stack (Elastic SIEM + OpenCTI, Llama‑2 + RL playbooks).
3. **Video Series** – Record short screencasts (5‑10 min) walking through the labs; embed them in the portal.
4. **Podcast & Guest Interviews** – Invite industry experts to discuss real‑world deployments; publish episodes on the portal.
5. **Community Forum** – Spin up a Discourse or GitHub Discussions space for readers to ask questions and share custom playbooks.
6. **Certification Path** – Draft a “Certified AI‑Sec Practitioner” curriculum with quizzes and a capstone project.
7. **Playbook Library** – Create a `playbooks/` directory with YAML/JSON templates for common incidents (phishing, lateral movement, ransomware).
8. **Glossary & FAQ** – Add a `docs/glossary.md` and `docs/faq.md` to demystify jargon and answer frequent questions.
9. **Chapter Summaries** – For each chapter, write a concise 1‑page summary with key takeaways, actionable bullets, and “next‑step” prompts.
10. **Interactive Quizzes** – Embed quizzes after each chapter to reinforce learning; use a simple JS quiz engine.
11. **Open‑Source Contribution Guide** – Provide a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explains how readers can add new tools, case studies, or fix bugs.
12. **Roadmap & Future Vision** – Expand Chapter 9 into a living document that tracks emerging AI techniques, regulatory changes, and community milestones.
