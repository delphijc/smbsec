# Chapter 1 – Summary

**Key Takeaways**
- The threat landscape is expanding across cloud, IoT, supply‑chain, and remote‑work vectors.
- Adversaries are increasingly sophisticated, using APT groups, ransomware‑as‑a‑service, and automated exploitation.
- Regulatory pressure (GDPR, CCPA, PCI‑DSS, AI‑specific frameworks) is tightening.
- Talent scarcity and tooling costs consume a large portion of security budgets.
- AI‑powered defense offers a force multiplier: rapid telemetry processing, automated triage, and scalable solutions on commodity hardware.

**Actionable Next Steps**
1. Map your organization’s current threat surface and identify high‑risk vectors.
2. Conduct a budget audit to quantify tooling vs. staffing costs.
3. Pilot an AI‑driven log summarization (e.g., Llama‑2) on a small data set.
4. Document the pilot results and refine the AI workflow.

**Next Chapter Preview**
- Chapter 2 dives into machine‑learning fundamentals tailored for security, covering supervised vs. unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
