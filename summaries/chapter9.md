# Chapter 9 – Summary

**Key Takeaways**
- Emerging AI: generative attack simulation, GNNs for supply‑chain, federated learning, XAI, zero‑shot learning.
- Threat evolution: AI‑assisted adversaries, supply‑chain complexity, new AI regulations, quantum‑resistant crypto.
- Roadmap 2025‑2035: consolidate stack (2025), generative simulators (2026), federated learning (2027), GNN supply‑chain (2028), XAI compliance (2029), post‑quantum crypto (2030), continuous improvement (2031‑35).
- Investment priorities: R&D 15 %, talent, tooling, governance, community.
- Success metrics: detection ↑20 %/yr, MTTC ↓10 %/yr, FP <5 %, 100 % compliance, 3:1 ROI.

**Actionable Next Steps**
1. Draft a 2025 consolidation plan: deploy LLM summarization, RL playbooks, vector search.
2. Identify a pilot for generative phishing simulation using Stable‑Diffusion.
3. Set up a federated learning prototype with a partner organization.
4. Build a GNN model for a small supply‑chain graph.
5. Integrate SHAP explanations into the alert pipeline.
6. Plan a migration to lattice‑based crypto for key exchanges.

**Next Chapter Preview**
- Chapter 10 will wrap up with a final synthesis, future outlook, and a call to action for the cybersecurity community.
