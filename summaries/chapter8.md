# Chapter 8 – Summary

**Key Takeaways**
- Case studies show measurable gains: MTTC down 55 %, false‑positive rate down 58 %, analyst effort down 32 %, 100 % compliance pass.
- FinTech: Elastic SIEM + OpenCTI + LLM summarization → MTTC 4 h → 45 min.
- Healthcare: Wazuh + FAISS → lateral movement detection, containment 2 h → 15 min.
- E‑Commerce: Llama‑2 + Stable‑Baselines3 → phishing click‑through 70 % drop.
- Manufacturing: Neo4j + GNNs → supply‑chain attack prevented.
- Replication steps: start small, iterate, measure, document.

**Actionable Next Steps**
1. Create a pilot plan for a small team: deploy LLM summarization first.
2. Set up metrics dashboards (MTTC, FP rate, analyst hours).
3. Document lessons learned in a shared playbook.
4. Prepare a case‑study template for future deployments.

**Next Chapter Preview**
- Chapter 9 will cover the hands‑on lab environment, including Docker‑Compose stacks for Elastic, Wazuh, OpenCTI, and the AI services.
