## The Project

This site is dedicated to making AI-enabled cybersecurity accessible and practical for small to medium-sized businesses. We believe that advanced security capabilities shouldn't be limited to large enterprises with extensive resources.

## Our Mission

To bridge the gap between enterprise-level AI security solutions and the practical needs of SMB security teams through:

- **Practical guidance** tailored for resource-constrained environments
- **Real-world examples** that SMBs can implement
- **Clear explanations** of complex AI/ML security concepts
- **Actionable strategies** for building effective blue team operations
