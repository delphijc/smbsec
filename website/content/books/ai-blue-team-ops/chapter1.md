# Chapter 1 – The Cybersecurity Landscape Today

## 1.1 The Evolving Threat Environment
- **Attack surface expansion**: Cloud, IoT, supply‑chain, and remote‑work vectors.
- **Sophistication of adversaries**: APT groups, ransomware‑as‑a‑service, and automated exploitation.
- **Regulatory pressure**: GDPR, CCPA, PCI‑DSS, and emerging AI‑specific compliance frameworks.

## 1.2 Budget and Staffing Constraints
- **Talent scarcity**: 70% of organizations report difficulty hiring qualified security professionals.
- **Cost of tooling**: Commercial SIEMs, threat‑intel feeds, and managed services can consume 30–40% of a security budget.
- **Operational overhead**: Manual triage, alert fatigue, and incident‑response playbook maintenance.

## 1.3 The Case for AI‑Powered Defense
- **Force multiplier**: AI can process terabytes of telemetry in seconds, surface hidden patterns, and prioritize alerts.
- **Automation of routine tasks**: Log parsing, IOC enrichment, and basic triage reduce analyst toil.
- **Scalability**: Open‑source AI models can run on commodity hardware or low‑cost cloud instances, fitting tight budgets.

## 1.4 Book Structure Overview
- **Foundations**: Core security concepts and AI fundamentals.
- **Tool‑centric chapters**: Each chapter focuses on a specific AI tool or technique and its practical deployment.
- **Case studies**: Real‑world deployments in small teams, linked to the reference file.
- **Implementation guide**: Step‑by‑step instructions for building a low‑cost AI security stack.
